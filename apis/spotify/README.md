Spotify APIs
=============

Heyo! nevyn@spotify.com and phb@spotify.com are here to help you out with Spotify APIs this hackday. If you just want to get started ASAP, go to http://developer.spotify.com/ and just check out the API you want.

Still here? OK. Short intro: We have two APIs:

 * An [HTTP API for metadata](http://developer.spotify.com/en/metadata-api/overview/) (searches, lookups on artists/albums)
 * A [C API for playlist manipulation and music playback](http://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/)

We're working on a **new version of the HTTP API** which lets you browse playlists. I'm not sure if we'll get it up during the weekend, but if you want to try it out, give us a shout and we'll see what we can do.

We're about to release a **new version of libspotify** (0.0.7) with ARM support and tons of bug fixes. We've uploaded the binaries to this repository for Mac and Linux; if you want to play it safe, the 0.0.6 binaries are at the link above. 

**Libspotify requires a Premium subscription, but this is not a problem: we have free premium months available to hand out to anyone who wants to hack on libspotify, just come talk to us!**
