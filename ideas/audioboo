In from Audioboo <http://audioboo.fm>

    We're releasing some audioboo frameworks to a radio station next
    week, which integrate recording and playback into their existing
    iPhone app with a minimum of work. 
    
    Listeners will be able to send audio direct to the station, who
    can then moderate it and choose to push it live to the app and the
    web. 
    
    Combining this with some image updates and location stuff could
    potentially make for a very simple but effective app to build for
    participants at SxSW.
